    The lion’s mane jellyfish (*Cyanea capillata*) is one of the largest known species of jellyfish, named for its long, trailing tentacles that resemble a lion’s mane. It can have a bell diameter of over 2 meters (6.5 feet) and tentacles extending more than 30 meters (100 feet), though most are much smaller.
  </p>
  <p>
    These jellyfish are typically found in the cold, northern waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 
    especially in the Gulf of Maine, Arctic, and North Sea. They drift with ocean currents and feed on small fish, plankton, and other jellyfish, capturing prey with stinging cells in their tentacles.
  </p>
  <p>
    While their sting is painful, it is usually not dangerous to humans. Encounters are most common during the summer months, when they come closer to shore.
