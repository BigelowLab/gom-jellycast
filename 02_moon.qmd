    The moon jelly (*Aurelia aurita*) is a widely distributed and easily recognizable jellyfish, known for its translucent, saucer-shaped bell and four horseshoe-shaped gonads visible through the top. It typically grows to about 25–40 cm (10–16 inches) in diameter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moon jellies are found in coastal waters around the world and prefer calm bays and harbors. They feed mainly on small plankton and fish eggs, using their fringe of short tentacles and mucus-covered bell to trap food.

    While their sting is harmless to humans, they are often studied in aquariums and marine biology for their simple body structure and gentle movement.
