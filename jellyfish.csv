My sons had lots of questions for me I couldn’t answer! But we are so curious now - as we recently watched a documentary on Nature on PBS.  Here are some photos I took.  I have a few video of what was in the water.  Your folks, researchers and scientists are probably on it. But I thought we should share.  I am an artist and use sea glass in my work.
